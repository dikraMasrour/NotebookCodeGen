You will go through all the steps of creating an ML service from organizing a repository to setting up CI / CD and integrating an ML model into operation. Master the concept of reproducible and scalable research. Get acquainted with popular team development tools: GitLab, SnakeMake, MLFlow, DVC, learn how to unify the release cycle of machine learning models and software products created on their basis, and be able to automate testing of produced artifacts.<span>\n    \n## <span style=\"color:#FF6542;\">**I suggest to —Åheckout other works**<span>\n>[**Spaceship Titanic**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartushovdanil/deep-eda-to-infinity-and-beyond)  \n[**TPS FEB 22**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartushovdanil/tps-feb-22-advanced-eda)  \n[**TPS JAN 21 PART 2**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartushovdanil/overfit-me-catboost-lgbm)  \n[**TPS JAN 21 PART 1**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartushovdanil/tps-jan-22-eda-atboost-prophet)  \n[**TPS NOV 21**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartushovdanil/tps-nov21-4-begginers-rus-links)  \n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span style=\"color:#011936;\">**The concept of reproducible and scalable research**<span>\n<a id=\"1\"></a>\n\n**I want to start with explain that mlops is part of devops. The most part of your time you will write code in IDE and .py, after this guide, i hope you get knowledge and skills how to automate your code and be sure that everythink working okey. That`s also useful for kagglers, if you gonna get next level and tired of jupyter.** \n    \nSo, the first rule of MLOPS or any other research is 3R (non official called,  just called by me)\n\n>Repeatability (same team, same experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by the same team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same location on multiple trials.\n\n>Reproducibility (different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials.\n\n>Replicability (different team, same experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.    \n    \nSo in other words, your code or project, needs to be enough to use other people and suitable for different OS, python or packages versions. \n    \nA little later we will move on to an overview of the tools that will help us. But let's think about how we can do it manually?\n    \n> Write various installation instructions, according to the requirements.

You dont need care about OS or other problems with repeatability, docker is all you need.  \nK8S is optional, but if you have a large project with CI/CD, then it will distribute the load on the server\n    \n### <span style=\"color:#011936;\">**PyCharm**<span>\nI prefer this IDE, for me it is one of the most convenient and productive.\n    \n### <span style=\"color:#011936;\">**CLI**<span> \nThe CLI is a handy thing, because in the future, most likely you will have to run your code from the console or some tools will have requirements for this.
