As we all know the best way to learn about a topic is to build something and make a kernel about it. My plan is to make a series of notebooks where I work may way towards a full-fledged chess AI named RLC (Reinforcement Learning Chess). \n\nTackling chess is a big challenge, mainly because of its huge state-space. Therefore I start with simpler forms of chess and solve these problems with elementary RL-techniques. Gradually I will expand this untill we end up in a chess AI that can play actual games of chess somewhat intelligibly. The forms of chess I want to cover in my notebooks are:  \n\n#### 1. Move Chess \n- Goal: Learn to find the shortest path between 2 squares on a chess board  \n- Motivation: Move Chess has a small statespace, which allows us to tackle this with simple RL algorithms.\n- Concepts: Dynamic Programming, Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Synchronous & Asynchronous back-ups, Monte Carlo (MC) Prediction, MC Control, Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, TD control, TD-lambda, SARSA(-max)\n\n#### 2. Capture Chess\n- Goal: Capture as many pieces from the opponent within n fullmoves\n- Motivation: Piece captures happen more frequently than win-lose-draw events. This give the algorithm more information to learn from.\n- Concepts: Q-learning, value function approximation, experience replay, fixed-q-targets, policy gradients, REINFORCE, actor-critic\n\n\n#### 3. Real Chess (a.k.a. chess)\n- Goal: Play chess competitively against a human beginner\n- Motivation: A RL chess AI\n- Concepts: Monte Carlo Tree Search\n\n#### Other notebooks\n[**Notebook 2: Model free learning**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-2-model-free-methods)  \n[**Notebook 3: Q-networks**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-3-q-networks)  \n[**Notebook 4: Policy Gradients**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-4-policy-gradients)  \n[**Notebook 5: Monte Carlo Tree Search**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-5-tree-search)\n\n\nIn my notebooks, I will describe and reference the Reinforcement Learning theory but I will not fully explain it. For that there are resources available that do a match better job at explaining RL than I could. For that my advice would be to check out David Silver's (Deepmind) lectures that are available on Youtube and the book Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto referenced below."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Notebook I: Solving Move Chess"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os\nimport inspect","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install python-chess  # Python-Chess is the Python Chess Package that handles the chess environment\n!pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/arjangroen/RLC.git  # RLC is the Reinforcement Learning package","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from RLC.move_chess.environment import Board\nfrom RLC.move_chess.agent import Piece\nfrom RLC.move_chess.learn import Reinforce","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The environment"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- The state space is a 8 by 8 grid\n- The starting state S is the top-left square (0,0)\n- The terminal state F is square (5,7). \n- Every move from state to state gives a reward of minus 1\n- Naturally the best policy for this evironment is to move from S to F in the lowest amount of moves possible."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"env = Board()\nenv.render()\nenv.visual_board","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The agent\n- The agent is a chess Piece (king, queen, rook, knight or bishop)\n- The agent has a behavior policy determining what the agent does in what state"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"p = Piece(piece='king')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reinforce\n- The reinforce object contains the algorithms for solving move chess\n- The agent and the environment are attributes of the Reinforce object"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"r = Reinforce(p,env)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.1 State Evaluation"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Theory**\n\nIf we want our agent to optimize its rewards, we want its policy to guide behavior towards the states with the highest value.
